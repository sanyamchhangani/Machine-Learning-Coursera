Contents - 
1. Week 2- Linear regression - Implemented linear regression and applied it to data.
2. Week 3- Logistic Regression - Implemented logistic regression and applied it to two different datasets.
3. Week 4- Neural Networks representation - Implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
4. Week 5- Neural Networks - Implemented the Backpropagation Algorithm and trained neural networks to predict hand-written digits. The accuracy of 20 * 20 pixel images was around 96%.
